# Blink_detection
 Blink your eyes to press keyboard up arrow key.
 This python program detects the user's eyes using "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" file and predicts if it counts as a blink or not. If it is a blink, the program presses and releases the "up arrow" key on the keyboard. 
 This allows you to play the infamous dino game by merely blinking your eyes!
 Steps to play the game:
 1) open chrome browser
 2) disconnect internet connection
 3) go to the dino game
 4) execute the "blink_to_press_up.py" python file.
 5) place your cursor on the dino game and click to start.
 6) then go hands free, blink away to glory!
